abstract = {Projective mapping, also called napping, was introduced to the chemosensory community as a multidimensional data-collection method in which panelists place products directly into a two-dimensional space based on their perceived similarity. Sorting is a form of nominal level measurement in that a pair of products is either placed in the same category or not for each subject. Analysis of projective mapping data is typically performed with multiple factor analysis, and sorting is typically performed with multidimensional scaling (MDS). This study took an exploratory empirical look at apple and cheese product systems separately in a direct comparison of sorting (analyzed by MDS) with projective mapping (analyzed with MFA). Product maps were similar for both the sorting and projective mapping procedures. Subjects had more difficulty with the apples than the cheeses. Cluster analysis was easier to interpret for the napping configurations. Sorting has already gained wide use in such areas of applied sensory science as competitive evaluation, flavor exploration and category appraisals, among others. Projective mapping, also known as the napping method, was introduced relatively recently to the sensory community and has already gained much interest. It may have certain advantages or disadvantages of sorting and, at least in theory, can be applied in the same situations. This paper provides a comparison of projective mapping and sorting, and illustrates some of the differences and advantages/disadvantages of each method. It provides examples of the types of data analysis that can be used for each method. Based on this study, we conclude that projective mapping may have advantages over sorting where the product space contains relatively similar products, such as different apples or cheddar cheeses. Cluster analysis enriches the projective mapping interpretation by helping differentiate product groupings.},

@article{Nestrud2008,
abstract = {Projective mapping, also known as the nappe map technique is a method proposed for gathering similarity data in which panelists are directed to place products on a two dimensional surface. Two groups of participants, experienced chefs and consumers, performed this task and traditional attribute scaling. Ten fresh squeezed citrus juices and one commercial juice were judged along with two duplicates for a total of 13 products. Nappe map data were analyzed using multifactor analysis (MFA) and generalized procrustes analysis (GPA). Scaling data were analyzed using MFA, GPA, and principle components analysis (PCA). Configurations were generally similar, with juices differentiated by an axis opposing sweet, orange, floral and fruity characteristics against grapefruit, bitter and sour notes. A textural (pith vs. smooth) axis was also evident in some plots. Nappe configurations were similar, especially comparing GPA and MFA analyses within a group. Comparisons of configurations between groups were less similar, as shown by lower Rv coefficients. Configurations showed a good correspondence of scaled attribute results to nappe results for the consumers, but less so for the chefs, suggesting different criteria for the chefs in the nappe and scaling tasks. The nappe method may uncover perceptions not captured by traditional scaling and PCA especially for groups such as chefs, who may have more idiosyncratic perceptions of the critical sensory attributes.

   abstract = {Napping is a multivariate sensory method in which participants physically place stimuli on a large sheet of paper and orient them so that the distance between pairs represents a measure of dissimilarity. The two-dimensional nature of the task may be a limitation to the ability of this and similar methodologies to recover information about complex stimuli. In the first investigation, eight simulated three-dimensional stimuli were created with two different levels for each attribute. Simulated napping experiments had groups of participants attend to two of the dimensions with different probabilities. Multiple factor analysis (an analytical multivariate statistical procedure that can be thought of as a principle components analysis on the individuals) and MDS-INDSCAL (a variation on multidimensional scaling that finds a common configuration through reducing a stress measure associated with lack of fit) recovered full dimensionality from these data, although MFA had trouble when attention was the most unbalanced. In the second experiment, a human napping experiment was designed using custom three-dimensional stimuli: shapes with two levels each of size, color, and shape attributes. This experiment confirmed the results of Experiment 1, as both MDS-INDSCAL and MFA analyses again recovered the full dimensionality of the stimuli.},

 consumer scientist to efficiently analyze large numbers of combinations of food items,
 such as components on a salad. In this study, we tested the validity of such an approach.
 We began by asking subjects whether or not pairs of ingredients would be appropriate
 to combine on a salad. Next, using graph theoretic methods, we predicted which
 combinations of 3-8 components should go together and, perhaps more importantly,
 which combinations should not. Subjects were then asked whether or not particular
 combinations were appropriate to combine on a salad. A paired Wilcoxon test between
 the predicted and non-predicted combinations was significant for all combination},
